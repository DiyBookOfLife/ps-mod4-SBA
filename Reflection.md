 # SBA Reflection

 ### Challenges faced during the project:

- The biggest challenge for me was figuring out the best way to handle form data in JavaScript. I realized I was mixing different methods to grab values from the form, which made things confusing and harder to find a solution. I also ran into small issues where values were not showing up the way I expected, which slowed me down.

 ### How you approaded solving those challenges:

- To fix this, I had to stop and focus specifically on forms for a while to understand how they work in the DOM. I repeatedly retest, trial and error, while using console.log() and compared what different methods were doing. 

 ### What you would improve if given more time: 

- If I had more time, I would add better validation and user feedback so the form is more user friendly, like a 'successfully added' message when a new task is added. Also, I would update the layout by adding more bootstrap styles to visually separate the form from the tasks list.
